A major problem being faced by municipalities around the world is maintaining the
condition of roads be it summer, the monsoons (when it is at its worst) or any weather
condition as a matter of fact. And although it’s the responsibility of the authorities to make
sure the roads are free of damage, at times they overlook the problem, and most times don’t
even know that the problem exists. According to “Safety Resource Center”, approximately
3 Billion US Dollars are spent by motorists for repair of blown tires, busted axles, and other
damage to their vehicles. Over the past five years around 16 million drivers across the U.S. have suffered damage
from potholes as per an article from “American Automobile Association (AAA)”


Maintaining the road condition is a challenge with constant weather changes, wear
and tear, low budgets for the municipalities. Also, not to forget keeping people informed is
a task. So, this is an app aimed at solving the challenges mentioned. A reporting system,
where the citizen can capture the scene of an area, which will be fed to a machine learning
model that will geocode, validate and track down potholes in the scene. This has been
achieved by training for object tracking on multiple images and developed using
convolutional neural networks. Users can see the damage on the roads using a
mobile application or through their browsers. A dynamic report is also  generated for the closest authority of concern which they can view and update to
create and manage work orders using their own jurisdiction-based web/mobile app-based
dashboard.
